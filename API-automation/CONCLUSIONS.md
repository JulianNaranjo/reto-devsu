## Conclusions
These APIs did not have documentation, so for this exercise it was very necessary to carry out the same process at the Web application level, in order to identify the body parameters. Once these were obtained, which are "username": and "password": Postman was used to execute them manually and see how they behaved and what the responses were to the different executions and what they are part of the assertion to ensure that the endpoints are fully complying and not just validating the 200 status, since as can be seen, they all respond under the same status.

It is also very particular that once the user is created, this does not return anything in the response.

Finally, at a general level, it seemed like a simple exercise to me.
